Software delivery has never been more critical to the success of business in every industry. It’s also never been more complex. Expectations for delivering high-quality software incredibly fast have skyrocketed - yesterday’s most exceptional product experiences are expected today to be more beautiful, intuitive, powerful, and affordable.

Since 2019, we have been analysing the anonymous data from all of the jobs and workflows run on our platform, and we've identified a set of recommended baseline engineering metrics as related to CI/CD, and we've been able to paint a picture of what it means to have an elite and holistic software delivery practice.
